## Description
The main goal of this project was to learn QGraphicsView and how to create a node editor. I started by refering this
page http://austinjbaker.com/node-editor-prototype and then trying to implement it on my own. I was able to get to point
where I got nodes created with varying inputs/ouptuts.

## Improvements:

- https://github.com/LeGoffLoic/Nodz

- https://github.com/LumaPictures/usd-qt : replace the sceneGraph viewer.
